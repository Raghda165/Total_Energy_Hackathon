Oil Spill Prediction Using Logistic Regression
This project implements a Logistic Regression model to predict the presence of oil spills in marine or industrial environments, based on data collected from a network of environmental and chemical sensors.
introduction:
The aim is to support safety and sustainability monitoring by classifying sensor input data as either "Oil Spill Detected" or "No Spill".

The model helps in:

Early detection of hazardous oil leaks

Supporting automated safety and response systems

Enabling real-time environmental monitoring

 Data:
Source: IEEE (open dataset for academic and research purposes)

Features: The dataset includes a variety of environmental measurements captured by sensors, such as chemical concentrations, pressure levels, or other relevant indicators.

Target: 
    Binary label indicating presence (1) or absence (0) of oil spill

 Model:
Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Reason for Use: Fast, interpretable, well-suited for binary classification tasks.

Performance Metrics:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1 Score
